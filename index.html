We pride ourselves on being a PvP guild, so it is a requirement that you must have at least 50 rating to join. You must also maintain that rating throughout the month. If you are on hiatus for more than 1 month, you will be kicked. You may still have access to the Empire Discord, however. Many members can attest that they have improved massively since joining Empire, and if our player base continues to grow, we could easily get access to Guild Island, an exclusive island specifically for the Top 3 guilds..</p> </div>

                             Many of Empire's members have remained since the beginning of its creation. It goes without saying that many people love it here, mainly for the social aspect.
                              There are regular voice calls, and daily interaction with guild members is common. We've all become bonded over time and our friendships
                               will only continue to grow with the addition of new members to our community.</p> </div>

                            Many of our core members are dedicated PvP players who have years of experience and actively work their hardest to help newer players get a better understanding of the game. 
                            There are many designated roles for each person. If you show that, over time, you are making significant contributions to the guild, you will be rewarded with roles that represent your contributions.
                            We encourage debate and discussion about pressing metagame topics, and no opinions (no matter how trivial) will go ignored. Overall, we strive for a healthy balance of fun and competitiveness and you will undoubtedly learn new things upon joining our guild.
